title: Write Paper With Spacemacs and Org Mode
excerpt: This tutorial talks about how to write paper with spacemacs and org mode
---
#+END_EXPORT

* Rationale
- Spacemacs makes Emacs easy to set up.
- Latex is not really readable.
- Learning org-mode once, and you do not need to worry about Markdown, HTML,
  Latex set up in lots of cases. You also get todo lists, calendars if you want.

* Prerequisites
- Know and like [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. This is really not the place to learn Emacs from scratch.
- Basic understanding of Latex. If you are reading this post, you probably have
  already written tons of Latex.
- [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] installed properly.
- Know hot to compile Latex.

* Preparations
** Conventions
- I will use =C-x= for "Ctrl + x", =C-X= for "Ctrl + Shift + x", =M-x= for
  "Alt + x", etc.
- I will use =SPC= for the space key.
- Notice in VIM mode, =SPC SPC= is equivalent to =M-x=. Both allow you to
  execute an Emacs command.
** Install the required layers
If you already know Spacemacs setup, you can skip this section.

Layers in Spacemacs are a bunch of packages put together for a specific purpose.
We will be using =latex=, =bibtex=, and =org= layers.

In Spacemacs, =SPC f e d= to open the =.spacemacs= file. Spacemacs key sequences
usually follow a logical order. In this case =f= represents "files", =e=
represents "emacs", =d= represents "dot-file". the "dot-file" is the Spacemacs
configuration file, normally located at =~/.spacemacs=.

In dot-file, search for the variable =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers=,
ignoring the comments, it should look somewhat like the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
'()
#+END_SRC
This is where we add layers. We need to add =latex=, =bibtex=, and =org= and the
variable now looks like the following. =auto-completion= and =shell= are also
absolutely recommended for obvious reasons. =helm= should already be installed
when you install Spacemacs. 
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
'(
  latex
  bibtex
  org
  helm
  auto-completion
  shell
  ;; other layers go here
  )
#+END_SRC
Save this file by =SPC f s= Now =SPC q r= to restart Spacemacs. Spacemacs will
install and configure these layers automatically.
** Create your paper
Find your favorite place in the file system and create a new folder. The files
we will be editing has a =.org= suffix. I will use =paper.org= in the rest of
this post.

* Hello Org-mode
Org-mode is a powerful plain-text system. You can learn more from its website
[[http://orgmode.org]]. This post will focus on how to efficiently write papers with
it.
** Latex headers
In Latex, we usually start with the following lines
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\title{Awesome Title}
\author{ My Awesome Name }
\date{\today}
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\end{document}
#+END_SRC
Then we copy these lines around all the time.

With org-mode, we do not need to deal with these nonsense anymore. Most of these
lines will be generated by default. Instead we need the following
#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+TITLE: Awesome Title
#+AUTHOR: My Awesome Name
#+END_SRC
These lines are self-explanatory.

Most of the common Latex packages are included by default, such as =amsmath= and
=graphicx=. If you need additional package, for example =geometry= to control
the margins, you can add the following line.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[top=0.5in]{geometry}
#+END_SRC

Any options that normally appears at the top of the Latex file can be added this
way, for example, we can remove indentation by adding
#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+LATEX_HEADER: {\setlength{\parindent}{0cm}
#+END_SRC

** Sections, subsections, items, enumerate, etc.
Remember typing =\Section= and =\item= all the time? It is simpler with org. I
highly recommend check out the org manual at [[http://orgmode.org/manual/]]. I will
cover some basic usage here. Here is a basic example
#+BEGIN_SRC org
 * This is a section
 ** This is a subsection
   1. enumerate item 1
   2. enumerate item 2
   3. enumerate item 3
      - itemize item 1
      - itemize item 2
      - itemize item 3
   *bold*, /italic/, =code=
#+END_SRC

This piece of org text will be formatted into the following Latex code
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\section*{This is a section}
\subsection*{This is a subsection}
\begin{enumerate}
\item enumerate item 1
\item enumerate item 2
\item enumerate item 3
\begin{itemize}
\item itemize item 1
\item itemize item 2
\item itemize item 3
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{bold}, \emph{italic}, \texttt{code}
#+END_SRC
Looks great?

** Export to PDF
You can Export to PDF by the following keystrokes. First =C-c C-e= will open a
export dispatch. You can follow the instructions in the window and press =l p=
to export to a pdf file, or press =l o= to generate the file and open it.

** Bibliography made easy
(Don't tell your rhetoric teacher)

*Important!* We need to tell Latex to use bibtex. Otherwise you will be running
 into weird issues like I did. Add the following lines to the =user-config=
 section of the =.spacemacs= file. So that the user config looks like the
 following.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
  (setq org-latex-pdf-process 
     '("latexmk -pdflatex='pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode' -pdf -bibtex -f %f"))
  ;; Other configurations
  )
#+END_SRC
Restart Spacemacas or simply reload the =.spacemacs= file by =SPC f e R= for
this change to take effect.

Now we need to create a =.bib= file to hold the references. You can find out
more about bibtex [[http://www.bibtex.org/Format/][here]]. Lets call the =.bib= file =ref.bib=. Now at the end of
=paper.org=, add the following lines
#+BEGIN_SRC
bibliographystyle:ieeetr
bibliography:ref.bib
#+END_SRC
The first line tells the bibtex to use IEEE style. You can also change it to
other styles. The bibliography will not work until you provide a correct style.
The second line is the place to search for references.

Now press =C-c ]= to open helm-bibtex buffer. You can type in the title of any
paper, then =C-n= to your preferred reference site (e.g. Arxiv) and press
=Enter=. You will get a list of search results. Put the cursor on the paper you
want and press =c= to copy or =C= to copy and close the search window. Now go to
=ref.bib=, paste the entry there and save.

Now go back to =paper.org=, press =C-c ]= again. This time you will see the
entry you just saved is displayed. Press enter to insert it at any place. Export
the file to pdf and all references are magically generated.
