* What to expect
I will talk about what Perlin noise is and how it is used. For simplicity, I
will only talk about the 2D case. I will mostly focus on the mathematical
description with a simple implementation in JavaScript.

There are already tons of great posts on Perlin noise. Here are some examples,
http://flafla2.github.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html,
[[http://lodev.org/cgtutor/randomnoise.html]],

These are recommended but not required to understand this post. They are also
themed for programmers. I believe a better way to learn algorithms is from
formal mathematical descriptions. Even without writing code, mathematical
formulas lead to a better understanding.

* Background
** What is Perlin noise
*Perlin noise* is an algorithm used to generate natural looking objects, clouds,
 terrain, hand writing, etc. If you want to *generate* the nature, this is the
 right thing for you.

** Application of Perlin noise
- Minecraft uses modified 3D Perlin noise for its terrain generation. Starbound
  used 2D Perlin noise, and here is a great post describing the method
  [[https://playstarbound.com/october-27th-caves/]].

* Algorithm description
Please note that I made up all the math myself. Please tell me if you spotted
any mistakes or inconsistencies with the algorithm.

I will add some pictures later for better illustration...
** Procedure for noise generation
Perlin noise is based on random "gradients" at grid points. Ultimately, N-dimensional
Perlin noise is a function 
\[P: \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}\]

This function assigns a "height" to each point in the N-dimensional space. In 2D,
it is also known as a height map. Of course, we can see the function needs be
smooth to make sense.

For simplicity, I will describe the procedure in 2D. If you are interested in
higher dimensional Perlin noise, you can simply replace "2" in the following
context with "N", replace "line" with "hyper plane", replace "circle" with
"hyper sphere", etc.

First, we divide the $xy$ plane into a grid with vertical and horizontal lines
at integer coordinates. Each point with integer coordinates is called a *grid
point*. We can see $\mathbb{Z}^2$ the set of all grid points.

At each grid point, we randomly assign a "gradient" to the point. The "gradient"
here is not the same gradient as in calculus, but it has similar purposes. The
random function we take here maps anything uniformly at random to the unit
circle $C$.
\[C=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: x^2 + y^2 = 1\}\]

We use $g$ for the function that maps $\mathbb{Z}^2$ to $C$.
\[g: \mathbb{Z}^2\to C\]

Now we fill in the place inside the grid. Consider a single grid with 4 corner
points, $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_1, y_2)$, $(x_2, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and a point
$(x,y)$ inside this grid. Let $v_{ij}=g(x_i, y_j)$ representing the gradient at
$(x_i, y_j)$. 

We first decide that for each grid point, if its gradient is "pointing towards"
$(x,y)$, it wants to raise $(x,y)$, otherwise it wants to lower it. So the
direction of the "gradient" represents the "uphill" direction. This is also the
reason why it is called "gradient" in the first place. We can use a dot product
to achieve this. Let $h_{ij}$ represent how much $(x_i, y_j)$ wants to raise
$(x,y)$. We have

\[h_{ij}=v_{ij}^T \begin{bmatrix}x-x_i \\ y-y_j\end{bmatrix}\]

We then make the second decision: If $(x_i,y_j)$ is farther away from $(x, y)$,
it has less effect on the height of $(x,y)$. For example, If $(x,y)$ is located
at the center of the 4 grid points, the 4 grid points have equal effect on
$(x,y)$. This step can be achieved with interpolation. For simplicity, we look
at linear interpolation first.

\[\mbox{lerp}: S\times S\times [0,1]\to S\]
\[\mbox{lerp}(h_1, h_2, \lambda) = (1-\lambda)h_1 + \lambda h_2\]

Now we perform a linear interpolation between $h_{11}, h_{12}$ and a linear
interpolation between $h_{21}, h_{22}$.

\[h_1 = \mbox{lerp}(h_{11}, h_{12}, y - y_1)\]
\[h_2 = \mbox{lerp}(h_{21}, h_{22}, y - y_1)\]

Next we perform another linear interpolation between $h_1, h_2$.

\[h = \mbox{lerp}(h_1, h_2, x - x_1)\]

#+END_EXPORT


And finally we set $P(x,y) = h$. Now we have properly defined $P$. We call this
$P$ the generated Perlin noise.

Notice if we use different random function $g$, we will get different Perlin
noise. In practice, to make sure we generate the same noise each time, we can
take the random function to be some *Hash function* $g$. Since we apparently
cannot sample from a continuous space, we can divide the unit circle into lots
of points and sample from the discretized unit circle instead.

Finally, we need to discretize the noise itself. We need a proper sample rate
and that's it. The sample rate should be relatively small. If we sample at all
grid points, then we will have a flat surface always, which is not desired. This
effect will be discussed next.

** Extensions
*** Effect on the grid points
Now you might be thinking that the algorithm is flawed when you look at the grid
points. For example, when $(x ,y)=(x_1, y_1)$ where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a grid
point. The dot product gives $h_{11}=0$, and the interpolations give $h=h_{11}$.
So each grid point will have $0$ as its height no matter how we change the
noise.

This effect is indeed a big problem, but if we superpose a ton of different
Perlin noise together, the effect is not quite noticeable. I personally think of
this like the superposition of sines and cosines.

*** Higher dimensions
In higher dimensions, generating points uniformly at random is not as intuitive
as in the 2D case. Although there are plenty of methods out there, efficiency
could be an issue. If you are creating a game and you need very high
performance, a nice workaround is generate a ton of points on the hyper sphere
beforehand and then random sample on them. In fact, total randomness may not
even be a good thing, in Perlin's improved noise, he chose only 12 directions to
sample from.

*** Amplitude, frequency, and superposition
Clearly, using the construction above, the height is restricted to a certain
range. To change this range, we can simply multiply $P(x,y)$ by a constant $R$
and get 

\[P'(x,y) = RP(x,y)\]

$P'$ is a Perlin noise with its amplitude scaled by $R$.

Similarly, this original Perlin noise will have bumps inside almost every grid.
If you want larger bumps, you can stretch the noise on the plane. The
transformation that stretches an object on the plane can be described as

\[P'(x,y) = P(x/s, y/s)\]

$P'$ is a Perlin noise stretched $s$ times in the 2 directions on the plane.
Higher $s$ means lower frequency.

Now we have seen how to stretch the noise vertically and horizontally. we can
similarly translate the noise on the plane by taking $P'(x,y)=P(x-x_0,
y-y_0)$.

Finally, we can add up a bunch of Perlin noise with different
parameters(different translation, scaling, and hash function). We can
intuitively see that low frequency represents large-scale terrain changes
(hills, basins), and high frequency represents small-scale terrain changes
(bumps). Putting it all together

\[P'(x,y) = \sum_i R_iP_i((x-x_i)/s_i, (y-y_i)/s_i)\]
Or if you prefer frequency
\[P'(x,y) = \sum_i R_iP_i(f_i(x-x_i), f_i(y-y_i))\]

This is what we want to implement.

* Implementation
In this section I will use Typescript since types make everything clear. If you
only know JavaScript, you should be able to follow without a problem.

First we implement a function that randomly samples point on the unit circle.
For simplicity, I assume we already have a hash function that generates integers
in range $[0,255]$ based on coordinates. Call this function $hash(x,y)$. Such
function can be found in the [[https://github.com/ckknight/random-js][random-js]] package. For example, you can do
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
Random(Random.engines.mt19937().seedWithArray([x,y,42])).integer(0, 255);
#+END_SRC
Now we generate a look up table for the circle.
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
const length = 255;
const grad = [];
for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
  grad.push([Math.cos(2 * Math.PI / i), Math.sin(2 * Math.PI / i)]);
}
function g(x: number, y: number) {
  return grad[hash(x, y)];
}
#+END_SRC
Linear interpolation $\mbox{lerp}(h_1, h_2, \lambda)$ and dot product might be useful
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
function lerp(h1: number, h2: number, lambda: number) {
  return (1-lambda) * h1 + lambda * h2;
}

function dot(v1: number[], v2: number[]) {
  return v1[0] * v2[0] + v1[1] * v2[1];
}
#+END_SRC
Now we can implement the perlin noise for arbitrary point $(x,y)$.
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
function noise(x: number, y: number, g: (x: number, y: number) => number[]) {
  const x1 = Math.floor(x);
  const y1 = Math.floor(y);
  const x2 = x1 + 1;
  const y2 = y1 + 1;
  
  const h11 = dot(g(x1, y1), [x-x1, y-y1]);
  const h12 = dot(g(x1, y2), [x-x1, y-y2]);
  const h21 = dot(g(x2, y1), [x-x2, y-y1]);
  const h22 = dot(g(x2, y2), [x-x2, y-y2]);
  const h1 = lerp(h11, h12, y-y1);
  const h2 = lerp(h21, h22, y-y1);
  const h = lerp(h1, h2, x-x1);
  // Yes, I know there is a lot to improve. Here I just stick to the math.

  return h;
}
#+END_SRC
Now we can use the function above and superimpose
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
function superimposedNoise(
    x: number, y: number,
    amplitudes: number[],
    translationXs: number[], 
    translationYs: number[], 
    frequencies: number[],
    hashFunctions: ((x: number, y: number) => number[])[]) {
  let s = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < amplitudes; i++) {
    s += amplitudes[i] * noise(frequencies[i] * (x - translationXs[i]), frequencies[i] * (y - translationYs[i]), hashFunctions[i]);
  }
  return s;
}    
#+END_SRC
Now you just need to find some parameters, discretize the plane, and feed each
point in the discretized plane into the function. The drawing details will not
be discussed here. You should be able to learn it from any computer graphics
tutorial.
